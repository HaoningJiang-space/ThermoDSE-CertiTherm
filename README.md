# CertiTherm

CertiTherm synthesizes the least-cost physical observation contract needed to
make an objective-ordered thermal chiplet-DSE decision identifiable.

The current method is **Decision-Sufficient Observation Synthesis (DSOS)**.
An ordered-decision decomposition reduces the global query exactly to
independent candidate-local minimum-cost hitting sets, and continuous LP
counterexample oracles solve those zero-error subproblems. An `OPTIMAL` result
carries the selected channels, exact cost, MILP lower bound, LP-relaxation
bound, and zero gap. `UNSYNTHESIZABLE` carries a cross-decision witness that
the complete registered channel library cannot separate. Numerical
uncertainty is always `UNRESOLVED`.

This is not ThermoDSE with another optimizer. ThermoDSE supplies workload and
architecture context; CertiTherm asks whether the information available at an
EDA stage is sufficient to justify the resulting architecture choice.

## Reproduce from a fresh clone

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:HaoningJiang-space/ThermoDSE-CertiTherm.git
cd ThermoDSE-CertiTherm
make bootstrap
make check
```

`bootstrap` checks out the pinned ThermoDSE and official HotSpot gitlinks,
creates a pinned Python 3.8-compatible environment, and builds HotSpot from an
exported source tree. It never modifies either submodule.

Claim-grade runs are executed on moe-server:

```bash
make reproduce-dev
make heldout
make package-dev package-heldout
```

The optional custom FP64 CUDA backend builds all zero/impulse responses in one
batch while retaining CPU HotSpot as the independent truth backend:

```bash
make gpu-bootstrap
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 make gpu-check
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 make gpu-production-parity
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 make reproduce-dev-gpu
```

The GPU path is currently admitted only for steady `grid64-avg` and
`grid128-avg` models with fixed linear package physics. Leakage feedback,
natural-convection iteration, microchannels, unsupported mapping modes, and
non-convergence fail visibly; they are never silently approximated. See
`docs/GPU_HOTSPOT_ROUND.md` and `docs/GPU_HOTSPOT_TEST_PLAN.md` for the frozen
accuracy, launch, and evidence contract.
The claim-grade A800 result and artifact digests are recorded in
`docs/GPU_HOTSPOT_EVIDENCE.md`.

Generated evidence is written outside Git under `artifacts/` as
TSV/CSV/NPZ/Markdown. No secret, machine-specific path, fitted power scale, or
3D-ICE conversion is part of the method.

Each workload's candidates are ordered by its captured ThermoDSE
`latency × energy / die_yield` value before thermal feasibility is applied.
The registered observation library spans module, chiplet, placement-region,
and post-route per-block power reports with frozen non-unit EDA-stage costs;
the initial coarse observation reveals total power only.

## Registered thermal family

- HotSpot block;
- HotSpot grid 64×64, block-average mapping;
- HotSpot grid 128×128, block-average mapping.

Grid max mapping is excluded from the LP because max-before-superposition is
nonlinear. Grid 256×256 is calibration-only. Operators are built by zero-power and
one-watt impulses and bound to the binary/config/floorplan/material digests.
The exported build tightens HotSpot's grid steady-state convergence threshold
from `1e-6` to `1e-7` and records that patch; this changes numerical
convergence, not the thermal equations or stack.
The three models form one fail-closed upper envelope: a candidate is SAFE
only when every registered model is below the limit. Per-model placed
decisions are still archived so disagreement remains visible, but power
channels are never asked to identify an unobservable simulator label.

## Evidence status

The pre-DSOS G1–G4 prototype is preserved at Git tag
`legacy-g1-g4-archived` and in the server-side evidence archive. Its 3D-ICE
`POWER_SCALE=16` replay and fixed-vs-adaptive G4 headline are withdrawn from
the active claim path. Historical reports under `CertiTherm/results/` and
`CertiTherm/audit/` are retained only as an audit trail; they are not current
results.

No held-out performance result is claimed until the frozen protocol completes
from a fresh clone and is archived unchanged.
